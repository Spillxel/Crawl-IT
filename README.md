# Crawl IT

A promotional game for BINFO @ uni.lu made for the Software Engineering Project course.

## Prerequisites

Note: README is incomplete, I will update this as soon as possible.

- Visual Studio 2017 (Visual Studio for Mac might work, not quite sure)
  - all of the Android/iOS development add-ons they allow you to choose during installation
- MonoGame + newest dev NuGet package (<http://www.monogame.net/downloads/)>
- Clone this repo and open the solution in Visual Studio, from here it should (hopefully) be as easy as running the Android project inside (iOS incomplete)
