# Crawl IT

Crawl IT is a dungeon crawler, quiz-style combat game with the purpose of
educating the player about the
[Bachelor in Applied Information Technology](https://binfo.uni.lu)
(short: BINFO) at the University of Luxembourg.

It started as a project for the **Software Engineering Project** course but
from there became a hobby project for us to code away at whenever we feel like.

Currently we plan on getting it to a state that we would personally consider
'finished'.

## Playing

Currently we plan on releasing all of our builds via the github release feature
in the form of **apk**'s only, as we don't have access to an MacOS device to
test on iOS.

We also push our new releases to
[Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.crawl.it).

## Development

Getting set-up for development should be relatively straight-forward:

- Have a Visual Studio 2019/2022 installation with up-to-date:
  - Mobile Development module (**Visual Studio Installer -> Modify**)
  - Android SDK
  - `MonoGame Project Templates` extension
- Clone the repo
- Open the included `CrawlIT.sln`
- The project should build and you should be able to deploy it on an android emulator
